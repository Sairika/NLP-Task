## E-commerce Customer Service Chatbot - Text Preprocessing Pipeline

This notebook presents a comprehensive **text preprocessing pipeline** designed for **e-commerce customer service chatbot data**. The primary objective is to **normalize user input** while **retaining emotional and contextual richness**, especially handling emojis and informal text, to enhance downstream tasks like sentiment analysis, intent detection, and chatbot responses.

### Features

* Emoji detection and translation to sentiment-rich tokens
* Text normalization: lowercasing, whitespace and punctuation handling
* Contraction expansion
* Slang and abbreviation handling
* Noise removal: URLs, HTML tags, special characters, etc.
* Tokenization and optional lemmatization/stemming
* Modular pipeline for easy integration with NLP workflows
